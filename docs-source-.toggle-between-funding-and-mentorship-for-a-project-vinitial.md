# Docs Source : .Toggle Between Funding and Mentorship for a Project vInitial

If a project participates in the Mentorship program, the project is available in CommunityBridge Funding _and_ in CommunityBridge Mentorship. Depending on your role, you use each service and toggle between them for these purposes:

* **CommunityBridge Funding** You use CommunityBridge Funding to raise, allocate, and manage funds for projects including projects that participate in the Mentorship program. 
* **CommunityBridge Mentorship** You use CommunityBridge Mentorship to view, offer, and manage mentorships for aspiring open source software contributors.

You can toggle between projects in Funding and Mentorship at any time, offering you a quick way to go to the same project details or the same projects list in either service. For example, go from Mentorship to Funding to view stipend payments listed in the Financial tab of your project.

**Do these steps:**

1. Go to project details or a project list.  
2. Click **Funding** or **Mentorship** depending on what service you are in:
   * From Mentorship, click **Funding**: ![](.gitbook/assets/7413840.png)
   * From Funding, click **Mentorship**: ![](.gitbook/assets/7413841.png)

The project details or project list appears in the service you selected.

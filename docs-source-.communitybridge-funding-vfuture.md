## What is Funding? <a id="id-.CommunityBridgeFundingvFuture-WhatisFunding?"></a>

CommunityBridge Funding is a platform to raise money via donations from individuals and corporations so projects can pay maintainers and developers directly for their development efforts or project expenses. The goal behind the platform is to ensure project communities have the resources to secure, maintain, and advance open source. 

The Linux Foundation will underwrite all platform and payment processor fees for the first $10M donated through CommunityBridge, so each of those dollars will go directly to funding projects. After the first $10M, donations will be charged a 5% platform fee plus the payment processorâ€™s fee to cover these costs. Individual donations start at $5 with company donations at $500.

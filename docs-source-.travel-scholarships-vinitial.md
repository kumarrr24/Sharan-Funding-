You can find out about Travel Scholarships and donate to the ones that you want to support. Travel Scholarships provide financial assistance to need-based individuals for travel expenses such as to fly to a technical summit. A Dashboard shows high-level information about funding including how funds are distributed and what the funding goals are. CommunityBridge Funding also maintains and displays a transparent ledger of incoming funds \(backer and sponsor transactions\) and outgoing funds \(developer invoices, expenses paid, and so on\) for each Travel Scholarship. The Financial tab lists all these transactions with details so that the entire community can view receipts of expenses.

3. Click a **Travel Scholarship** of interest.

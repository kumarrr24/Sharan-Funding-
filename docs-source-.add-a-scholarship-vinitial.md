# Docs Source : .Add a Scholarship vInitial

You can submit an application to add a Travel Scholarship fund to CommunityBridge Funding, such as to raise funds for travel to a Linux Foundation summit. In the application, invite individuals \(beneficiaries\) who you want to sponsor. These beneficiaries will receive an invitation to Expensify \(an expense management application\) so that they can submit reimbursements for their travel expenses.

Have these items handy before you begin:

* A logo file that represents your organization in JPG, PNG, SVG format with a maximum size of 2 MB

# Docs Source : Get Reimbursed for Project Development Work

Contributors and maintainers are developers who receive payment from project funds by requesting reimbursement for their time and expenses used to benefit the project. These individuals submit project-related business expenses for reimbursement through CommunityBridge Funding. The outgoing funds \(developer invoices, expenses paid, and so on\) for each project are reviewed by project maintainers and the Linux Foundation finance department. Project maintainers validate and approve or deny the expenses. A Linux Foundation administrator provides a final review and reimbursement.

You can add maintainers and contributors to your project. Select the project that you want to update, click **Edit Project**, and enter their email addresses in **Project Contributors**. After the authentication process is complete, these developers can submit expense reports for reimbursement or be paid for their time with funds raised.

Consider the following financial aspects of reimbursement:

* The Linux Foundation issues tax forms like a 1099 form \(and equivalent forms for Europe\) through the CommunityBridge Funding platform. Although The Linux Foundation cannot provide you with legal or tax advice, you may need to use these forms in connection with your own tax reporting obligations.
* CommunityBridge Funding uses third-party expense management and payment applications: Expensify and PayPal. Expensify is an online service application that lets you link to PayPal and generate expense reports.

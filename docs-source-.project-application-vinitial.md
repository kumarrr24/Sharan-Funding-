          ID number, for example: 24.</p>
        <p>The CII Badge Program is an open source secure development maturity model.
          Projects that have a CII badge showcase the project&#x2019;s commitment
          to security. Examples of criteria include basic open source development
          practices (website, open source license, and user engagement), use of change
          control tools, attention to quality (automated test suite), and focus on
          security (secure project delivery method, use of dynamic and static analysis
          tools, as appropriate for the project). Consumers of the badge are able
          to quickly assess which open source projects care about security-conscious
          development. Although participating in the CII Badge Program is optional,
          we encourage you to enroll in the program within the first 90 days from
          your application submission. The badge displays on your project dashboard
          to showcase your project&#x2019;s status and progress on security and other
          metrics.</p>
        <p>Click <b>Apply for CII</b> to get a badge and CII Project ID number if your
          project does not have one. You answer a questionnaire to be awarded a Best
          Practices Badge and a CII Project ID if you are approved. A questionnaire

## Project Beneficiaries <a id="id-.ProjectApplicationvInitial-ProjectBeneficiaries"></a>

Beneficiaries are individuals who work on a project and then request reimbursement for their time and expenses. If your project participates in a Mentorship program that includes stipends for mentees, add these mentees as beneficiaries.

The following table lists all the fields in the **Project Beneficiaries** panel of the Project Application:

| Field Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | The name of the person who you want to designate as a beneficiary of funds. |
| **Email** | The email of the project beneficiary. |

After you enter the name and email address of a person, click **+Add beneficiary** to add the person to the list. To add more beneficiaries, click **+ Add beneficiary** and complete the fields that appear.

When you submit the project, and after the project is approved, the Linux Foundation finance team sets up individual Expensify accounts for each beneficiary. Then, each beneficiary receives an email notification from the finance team that includes a link to their Expensify account. Beneficiaries are invited to join the custom Expensify policy as part of their participation in CommunityBridge. After accepting the invitation, beneficiaries have access to the policy where they can submit expenses for [reimbursement](docs-source-.get-reimbursed-vinitial.md) from CommunityBridge funds.

The finance team also works with the project administrator to set up a specific expense policy that applies to the project. All the beneficiary and project expenses are gated through the expense policy. For example, the policy might state a hotel price range that is acceptable for a beneficiary or a per diem food allowance. 

Only the project administrator can add or remove beneficiaries. The finance team is notified and adjusts the Expensify accounts accordingly.

## Annual Project Funding <a id="id-.ProjectApplicationvInitial-AnnualProjectFunding"></a>

**Annual Funding Goal** is a total project funding goal amount for the year. The Total Project Funding amount is a sum of the individual goal amounts.

## Fund Distribution <a id="id-.ProjectApplicationvInitial-FundDistribution"></a>

**Fund Distribution** enables goals for how you want to distribute funds in your project, and complete the fields that appearâ€”see the example below. Enter a percentage of your Annual Funding Goal amount to designate towards the goal. You can use the up/down arrows to select a percentage also.  
Be clear to potential sponsors about how you intend to use the funds. You can designate funds towards different types of expenses such as Marketing and Travel. Goal amounts are targets not limits, so you can continue raising money beyond your goal amount. As you see progress in one or more goals, you can \(and should\) update the goals to reflect how you plan to utilize these additional funds.

The Mentorship Goal lets you opt in to the Mentorship program and allocate funds for it. For details, see [Opt In Your Project to the Mentorship Program](docs-source-.opt-in-your-project-to-the-mentorship-program-vinitial.md).

## Financial Summary <a id="id-.ProjectApplicationvInitial-FinancialSummary"></a>

The Financial Summary shows the annual financial goal and progress towards it by individual goal. It shows a distribution report based on your selection from the **Fund Distribution** panel.

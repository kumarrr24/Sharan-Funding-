# Docs Source : .Add a Git Project vInitial

As a project administrator, you can submit an application to CommunityBridge Funding by adding a Git project.

Keep these items ready before you begin, although they are not required:

* The project ID for your [Core Infrastructure Initiative \(CII\) Badge Program](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/badge-program/) 
* The URL for your code of conduct \(the rules of behavior for the members of that group or organization\)
* A logo file that represents your project in JPG, PNG, SVG format with a maximum size of 2 MB
* A list of names and email addresses for the individuals who will benefit from working on the project

**Do these steps:**

1. Log in to [CommunityBridge Funding](https://funding.communitybridge.org/). For details, see [2019-11-04\_08-00-05\_Log In to CommunityBridge Funding](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=PROD&title=2019-11-04_08-00-05_Log+In+to+CommunityBridge+Funding&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=7416148)  
2. Click **Apply**. **Result:** "Start Raising Funds" appears.  
3. Select **ADD GIT PROJECT**. ![](.gitbook/assets/7416171.png) **Result:** A project application form appears that lets you provide information about your project.  
4. Complete the form fields.   For information about fields, see [Project Application](docs-source-.project-application-vinitial.md). Red asterisks indicate required fields. A bar at the top of the page shows your progress as you click **Next** through the form.  
5. Click **Submit Application**. The Linux Foundation administrator approves or rejects the application. The Linux Foundation sets up the financial aspects of your project and contributors, such as Expensify accounts and a project expense policy. **Note:** If you opt-in for Mentorship Goal, and complete the fields as per [Opt In Your Project to the Mentorship Program](docs-source-.opt-in-your-project-to-the-mentorship-program-vinitial.md), then prospective mentors receive email notification to participate in the Mentorship program. After your project accepts mentees, [Set Up Stipends](docs-source-.set-up-a-stipend-for-a-mentee-vinitial.md) for mentees.  
6. Optional: Go to your user account ![](.gitbook/assets/7416150.png) and select **My Projects** to see your pending project.  
  


   You can edit your project at any time. Select the project that you want to update and click **Edit Project**.

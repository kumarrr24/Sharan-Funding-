# Docs Source : CommunityBridge Funding

CommunityBridge Funding is a crowdfunding platform that empowers the open-source developers behind the worldâ€™s most important projects to get the support they need to thrive. Individuals and corporations can back the open-source projects they depend on with one-time or recurring financial contributions.

Projects with a demonstrated impact on the world use CommunityBridge Funding to raise money for the people, infrastructure, events, or other things needed to advance their project. No fees of any kind are charged against the first $10M raised through the platform, so developers can put more money to work to drive innovation, sustainability, and adoption.

Backers can quickly evaluate what projects to support based on security and other statistics. Individual grants start at $5 and corporate grants at $500. The Linux Foundation matches grants for projects that are focused on improving code security and growing the diversity of their communities.
